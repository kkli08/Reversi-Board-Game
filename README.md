## Game Rules
Here is a brief description of the Reversi board game. Reversi is played 
on a 8x8 board (like a chess board or a checkers board) with two players. 
The game uses pieces that are white on one side, and black on the other 
side, and as it progresses, these pieces can be flipped over to change 
their colour. One player plays white, the other player plays black, and 
the players take turns to place their pieces on the board. The game starts 
with two white and two black pieces placed in advance at the centre. 
Observe that rows and columns are labelled with letters, ranging from `a` 
to `h`. If a position is empty, it is represented by a dot (`.`). The initial 
board configuration in this game is as follows:

```text
  abcdefgh
a ........
b ........
c ........
d ...WB...
e ...BW...
f ........
g ........
h ........
```

A turn in the game consists of a player placing a piece of his/her own 
colour on a candidate empty board position, subject to the following two 
rules:

There must be a continuous straight line of piece(s) of the opponent’s 
colour in at least one of the eight directions from the candidate empty 
position (north, south, east, west, and diagonals).

In the position immediately following the continuous straight line 
mentioned in the rule above, a piece of the player’s own colour must 
already be placed.

In other words, a player can place a piece on an empty square if the 
square is adjacent to the opponent’s piece and the opponent’s pieces 
are sandwiched between the player’s own piece and the piece that the 
player just placed. After placing a piece at a position that meets the 
criteria above, all of the lines of the opponent’s pieces that meet the 
criteria above are then flipped to the player’s colour.

## Playing the Game
```text
  abcdefgh
a ........
b ........
c ........
d ...WB...
e ...BW...
f ........
g ........
h ........
Enter move for colour B (RowCol): cd
  abcdefgh
a ........
b ........
c ...B....
d ...BB...
e ...BW...
f ........
g ........
h ........
```

If a move is not valid, the utility should print `Invalid move. Try again.`, 
and then print the current board again for the player to try another move.

```text
Enter move for colour B (RowCol): dd
Invalid move. Try again.
  abcdefgh
a ........
b ........
c ........
d ...WB...
e ...BW...
f ........
g ........
h ........
Enter move for colour B (RowCol):
```

Once the first move is out of the way, the turns proceed following the 
game rules, alternating between Black and White unless one of the players 
has no move to make, in which case your program should print a message 
`W player has no valid move.` (i.e., for the case of the White player) 
and should prompt the opponent player for another move. After each turn, 
your utility must print the current board, and must detect whether the 
game is over. If your utility detects the game is over (i.e. a win or a 
draw), a message is printed and the program terminates. The specific 
messages to print are: `White wins by {x} points!`, `Black wins by 
{x} points!`, or `Draw!`, where `{x}` represents the number of additional 
pieces that the winner has on the board than the opponent.
